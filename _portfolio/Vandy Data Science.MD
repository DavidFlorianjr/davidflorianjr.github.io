I have been conducting research in the Pua lab since May 2022. My work has focused on the how house dust mite affects human bronchial epithelial cells; however, I am currently in the process of transitioning projects. The SyBBURE Seale Undergraduate Research Program has sponsered and mentored me throughout my time in the lab.
